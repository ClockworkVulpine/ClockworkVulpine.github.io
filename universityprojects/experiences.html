<div><img src="Orb Mod3.jpeg" alt="A man in a labcoat holding a 3D printed orb."><br>For one of the projects in Creative Technology, I was part of a group working for science communicator Barry Fitzgerald. He requested a way to aid his lectures on the electromagnetic spectrum. With the group, we came up with the Orb - a 3D printed orb that could display a sine wave, emit light, and vibrate, controlled by a gun-shaped remote. Additionally, we wrote a short skit in the style of superhero comics, matching other endeavors by Barry Fitzgerald as the Superhero Scientist. This skit would have the villain act as though the orb was reacting based on specific EM waves "emitted" by the gun.</div>
<div><img src="Setup Mod4.jpeg" alt="A parasol with cloth dividers, set up in a table."><br>For another project, as part of a different group, we were tasked with creating an interactive art experience. We designed an experience in which contestants were guided to complete 3 seemingly simple, but impossible, tasks. At the end of the experience, they were given a folder that showed them that the person they were competing against with these challenges was themselves, by way of a mirror embedded in the flyer.</div>
