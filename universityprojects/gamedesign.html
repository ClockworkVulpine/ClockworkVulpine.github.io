<div><img src="Chrono.png" alt="A screenshot of a game. It's in first person. The player is surrounded by walls and a laser gate."><br>As part of a project, we had to work in groups to design a game. Our group designed Chronosyphonics, a first-person puzzle platformer shooter, where the player needs to use multiple different types of bullets to solve a variety of puzzles. For this, I implemented most of the UI, the title screen, and an opening cinematic made with the entire group. We do have plans to develop this game further, but development is currently paused.</div>
